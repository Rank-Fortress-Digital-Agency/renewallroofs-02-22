                    The spring is a great time to do a roof inspection. The weather is mild and the leaves havenâ€™t started to come out yet, so you can get a good look at your roof. In this blog post, we will talk about what you should be looking for when you do your inspection, as well as how to prepare for it. We also recommend hiring a professional roofing company to inspect your roof for you. They will have the experience and knowledge necessary to identify any potential problems with your roof.

                    WHAT TO INSPECT FOR
                </h2>
                <p>
                    When you are inspecting your roof, you should be looking for any signs of damage. This can include missing or damaged shingles, leaks, or any other type of damage. If you see any of these things, it is important to have them repaired as soon as possible. Roof damage can quickly lead to more serious problems, so it is important to take care of it right away. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    If damage is not fixed or if it is ignored, it can lead to water infiltration, roof rot, and even structural damage. Roof replacement may then become necessary, which is a costly and time-consuming process.

                    PREPARATION
                </h2>
                <p>
                    In order to prepare for your roof inspection, you should first make sure that the ground below is clear. This means removing any debris, such as leaves or branches, from around your home. You should also check to make sure that all of your gutters are clean and free of debris. This will help you to avoid any potential damage to your roof during the inspection. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    It is also a good idea to trim any branches that are hanging over your roof. This will help the inspector to have a clear view of your roof and will help to prevent any damage from occurring.
